    <h1>Hello Coursera</h1>
    <p>Now I know why the files are not showing earlier. It was because I did not save the changes here.</p>
    <p>I encountered another issue in git push.</p>
    <h2>Read the suggestion and you will know.</h2>
    <p>It is not reading the changes. It says up-to-date despite the changes. How come? I saved it though.</p>
    <p>git commit -m "was forgotten" i gues. Hence the no push. Or was it not saved again properly.</p>
